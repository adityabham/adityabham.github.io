Machine Intelligence Intern

Implements machine learning and data analytics pipelines utilizing Python across multiple Internal Research and Development (IRaD) and Government Defense projects. 
- Utilizes machine learning algorithms including clustering, dimensionality reduction, linear and logistic regressions, Random Forest, and SVMs to develop supervised, semi-supervised and unsupervised learning-based models.
- Performs rigorous validation and hyperparameter tuning of machine learning models for statistical evaluation and optimization.
- Builds APIs to automate data collection. 
- Current projects include applying sensor fusion-based classification pipelines to enable persistent maritime awareness over ocean areas utilizing a distributed sensor network, and bioinformatics-based pipelines to predict virus family differentiation.
- Past projects included implementing scalable statistical techniques for the purpose of applying remote sensing-based technologies to detect underground structures on a global scale, and machine learning models to predict stem cell differentiation.
