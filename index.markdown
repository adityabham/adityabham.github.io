Hi, I’m Aditya. Welcome to my personal website! I’m currently a senior at Northeastern University 
studying Electrical Engineering. I am passionate about the areas of machine learning, Bayesian statistics & signal 
processing and will be attending Duke University for grad school in the Fall of 2021. At Duke I will be pursuing an MS degree 
in Electrical and Computer Engineering, concentrating in machine learning and data analytics. I’m originally from Livingston, 
New Jersey, and graduated from Livingston High School in 2016. In my free time, I enjoy watching/playing basketball, reading, 
producing music, and spending time with my friends.

Some of the major projects that I have worked on since starting engineering school: [Projects/Research](https://adityabham.github.io/Proj/)
