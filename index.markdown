Hi, I’m Aditya. Welcome to my personal website! I’m currently an undergraduate student at Northeastern University 
studying Electrical Engineering and an intern at The Charles Stark Draper Laboratory within the Machine Intelligence 
Group. I am passionate about the areas of machine learning, Bayesian statistics & signal processing and am hoping to 
attend graduate school in the Fall of 2021. I’m originally from Livingston, New Jersey, and graduated from Livingston 
High School in 2016. In my free time, I enjoy watching/playing basketball, reading, producing music, 
and spending time with my friends.

Some of the major projects that I have worked on since starting engineering school: [Projects/Research](https://adityabham.github.io/Proj/)
