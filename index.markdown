Hi, I’m Aditya. Welcome to my personal website! I recently graduated from Duke University 
(May 2023) with a Master’s Degree in Electrical and Computer Engineering specializing in 
machine learning and big data. I am passionate about the areas of machine learning, 
Bayesian statistics, programming and high performance computing and am currently working as 
a Data Scientist at [State Street Global Markets](https://statestreet.com/us/en/individual). I’m originally from 
Livingston, New Jersey, and graduated from Livingston High School in 2016. In my free time, I enjoy 
watching/playing basketball, reading, producing music, and spending time with my friends.
