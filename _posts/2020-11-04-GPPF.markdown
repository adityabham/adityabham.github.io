Description 
------
Topic: Enhancing Particle Filtering using Gaussian Processes
- Goal: Present an approach to Sequential Bayesian filtering that leverages both Monte Carlo algorithms and Gaussian process regression.
- Developed a Gaussian Process Particle Filter (GPPF) and resampling scheme utilizing Python and MATLAB to more accurately approximate the posterior distribution of some stochastic process from a set of random measures while addressing the issue of particle degeneracy in the context of Bayesian inference.
- In the process of generating a simulation, in Python, of a robot moving throughout a grid where the GPPF is utilized to estimate and track the robotâ€™s position quantifying the performance of the GPPF.

`MARKUP`

{% highlight ruby %}
def print_hi(name)
  puts "Hi, #{name}"
end
print_hi('Tom')
#=> prints 'Hi, Tom' to STDOUT.
