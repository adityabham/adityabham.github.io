### Description 
_June 2020-Present_<br/>
Northeastern University Department of Electrical & Computer Engineering                                           
- Currently collaborating with a team of five other ECE students to develop a novel solution regarding addressing and enforcing social distancing requirements through use of wireless sensor networks, machine learning algorithms, and the Internet of Things (IoT).
- Goal: Create a system to track human movement in public spaces, identify chokepoints and high-traffic hotspots, and provide visual and auditory indicators that enforce social distancing.

### High-Level Software Architecture

As a member of a the high-level software sub-team, my responsibilities include: <br/> 
- Helping develop a suite of motion-prediction (predictor) algorithms that model how people intend to move through the given space based on kinematic, behavioral, and social criteria.
- Creating a multi-classifier machine learning model the accepts predictions from the predictor algorithms to determine which algorithm is most accurate given the situational and environmental context.
